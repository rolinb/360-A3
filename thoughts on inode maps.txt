Okay inode map set up
if I make all of the inodes beforehand I can refind them, more easily?
if I do this with 1024 nodes i need to make 128 per block
block 2 has inodes 0-127 //ignore 0 and 1 but make them for easier math
block 3 has inodes 128-255
block 4 has inodes 256 - 383
block 5 has inodes 385 - 512
6 513 - 640
7 641 - 768
8 769 - 896
9 897 - 1024

byte 0,1 is inode num 2,3 is block num so everything divisible by 4 is an inode start
every even that is not divisible by 4 is an address

so inodes are in 0,1 4,5 8 9
addresses are in 2,3 6,7 10 11
